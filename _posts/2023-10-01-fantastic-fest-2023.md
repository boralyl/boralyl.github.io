## My Personal Top 5

There really were not any bad films I watched over the 4 days but my top 5 films I saw (in no particular order) were:

* [Property](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23061176/)
> A gang of disenfranchised farmhands traps a traumatized woman in her armored car in Daniel Bandeira’s Brazilian take on the home invasion.

This was a very dark film depicting the terrible class divide between the rich and the poor. Make sure you are prepared before viewing this one!
 
* [Crumb Catcher](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7178516/)
> An anxiety-inducing chamber piece that will make you fondly remember the worst high-pressure sales pitch you’ve ever delivered (or endured).

This film really took me by surprise.  It was extremely cringey with moments of absurd humor and an overall horror theme.

* [Totally Killer](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11426232/)
> 35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim.

This film was a great way to close out the festival. It was super fun and had me and the audience laughing out loud.

* [You'll Never Find Me](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22023218/)
> A strange woman desperate for shelter from a harrowing storm picks the wrong trailer to seek refuge... or did she choose exactly right?

A great single location horror film dripping with tension. The sound design in this movie was excellent.

* [The Origin](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7527682/)
> A group fights for survival against an unknown adversary in this stone age thriller.

Beautifully filmed with a twist that I wasn't expecting.
