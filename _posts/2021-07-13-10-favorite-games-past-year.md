The last year and a half has been quite a ride with the global pandemic. With so much
time being spent at home, I was able to try out a lot of new games on Steam and the
Nintendo Switch. Below is a list of my 10 favorites. With each I'll include a link to
the platform I personally played it on and a brief description on why I enjoyed it.

## # 10 - Song of Horror

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1096570/SONG_OF_HORROR_COMPLETE_EDITION/)

This was quite an interesting game, it's essentially a puzzle game with some horror elements
in an episodic format. The puzzles are very reminiscent of those in the early Resident
Evil games. Instead of using weapons to attack the evil, a mini game will begin that typically
involves some button mashing or timed presses. The game felt very rewarding when figuring
out a puzzle. That being said, some of them were extremely obtuse and near impossible to figure out
even with the available clues and required looking up hints online.

## # 9 - Alwa's Legacy

I had played the original [Alwa's Awakening](https://store.steampowered.com/app/549260/Alwas_Awakening/) before,
so I knew what to expect when picking up the sequel. It's very Zelda like with some
metroidvania characteristics thrown in. This sequel is quite polished and fixed most of
the issues I had with the original game.

## # 8 - Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/692850/Bloodstained_Ritual_of_the_Night/)

I ended up playing this on Steam after hearing about performance issues with the Nintendo
Switch version. This "Castlevania" game (all but the name) was developed by Koji Igarashi,
a long time developer of some of the original games. This RPG heavy action platformer
was exactly what I was looking for to scratch that itch for a new Castlevania title.

## # 7 Kaze and the Wild Masks

[Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kaze-and-the-wild-masks-switch/)

This was a surprise title for me. If you've ever played any of the Donky Kong Country
games, then you know what to expect with this title. The level design is very well done
and the platforming can be challenging at times. There are collectibles and other challenges
that enhance the replayability and kept me engaged for about 12 hours.

## # 6 - Ori and the Will of the Wisps

[![Ori and the Will of the Wisps](/assets/images/0020_ori.jpg)](/assets/images/0020_ori.jpg)

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1057090/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps/)

This action / platformer / metroidvania is the sequel to the excellent Ori and the Blind
Forest. It fixes most issues with the original game (not that there were many) and adds
a few new mechanics. I really enjoyed this game, but one thing I disliked is the difficulty
was dialed down a notch compared to the original.

## # 5 - Control Ultimate Edition

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/)

Control is a really unique experience, from the minds of the developers who made Alan Wake,
comes a 3D action game with some metroidvania characteristics. The story is bizarre as
are some of the enemies you'll encounter. The combat is incredibly fun using your powers
to control and throw objects. This game has a lot of content too and kept me busy for many
hours.

## # 4 - Salt and Sanctuary

[![Salt and Sanctuary](/assets/images/0020_salt_and_sanctuary.jpg)](/assets/images/0020_salt_and_sanctuary.jpg)

[Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/salt-and-sanctuary-switch/)

I might have bumped this up the list if it wasn't for the large learning curve and lack
of instructions on how to play the game. I completed the game not ever using many items
that I collected. The creed mechanic isn't explained very well either so I stuck with the
one I chose at the beginning. Another negative is not having a map. There are some large
areas, but over time you get the hang of it.

All of those negatives aside, this was a super fun metroidvania containing that reminded
me a lot of Hollow Knight and Blasphemous. The boss encounters were fun and the level design
and artwork was fantastic.

## # 3 - Spiritfarer

[![Spiritfarer](/assets/images/0020_spiritfarer.jpg)](/assets/images/0020_spiritfarer.jpg)

[Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/spiritfarer-switch/)

Of this list, this was the biggest surprise for me. When I read the description of the game
I really didn't think it was for me. In the game you explore the sea, visit towns, harvest
items that you can use to upgrade your ship and take care of spirits you encounter.

The artwork is gorgeous and it is super fun to control the main character. The stories you
encounter with each spirit really gave me the feels. Combined with the amazing soundtrack
this game invokes a lot of emotion and I highly recommend it.

## # 2 - Blasphemous

[![Blasphemous](/assets/images/0020_blasphemous.jpg)](/assets/images/0020_blasphemous.jpg)

[Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/blasphemous-switch/)

This was by far my favorite metroidvania I played in the last year and a half. The combat
is excellent and the story is incredibly dark. It has some souls-like mechanics mixed in
and has a pretty high level of difficulty.

I think this is the first game that I finished
and immediately started it again. The 2nd play through allows you to select a penance
that massively changes how you play the game. I chose the "Penitence of the True Guilt"
which meant the bile flasks no longer refilled my health but instead my Fervour. This meant
I used Fervour much more on my 2nd play through where I rarely used it the first time through.

## # 1 - Phoenotopia: Awakening

[![Phoenotopia: Awakening](/assets/images/0020_phoenotopia.jpg)](/assets/images/0020_phoenotopia.jpg)

[Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/phoenotopia-awakening-switch/)

My top spot goes to Pheonotopia: Awakening. I really wish more people knew about this
game and gave it a shot. I was drawn to it by some comparisons to Zelda II on the NES.
The overworld looks very similar to Zelda II where enemies spawn on the map and when
you run into them you jump into a 2-d side scroller to combat them. There are many
towns, NPCs, and secrets to find.

I enjoyed this game so much that even after finishing the game and beating the secret
boss, I kept playing to find every single secret. Fortunately there is an NPC that will
give you hints to aid you in finding the secrets which is more fun then just spilling
the beans. I dumped 70+ hours into this title and it is absolutely worth the price of
admission.
